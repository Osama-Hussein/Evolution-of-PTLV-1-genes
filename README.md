# Evolution of primate T-cell leukemia virus type 1 auxiliary genes and functional divergence of its antisense proteins 
## Evolution of PTLV-1 genes

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is derived from simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1), and together they form a broader category known as primate T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (PTLV-1). HTLV-1 encodes multiple proteins from overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) in the pX region. 

In this project we analyzed the potential of the publicly available PTLV-1 strains and our newly sequenced strains from Chimpanzee (Ptr: _Pan troglodytes_), African green monke (Csa: _Chlorocebus sabaeus_), and Japanese macaque (Mfu: _Macaca fuscata_) to encode the regulatory (Tax and Rex) and the auxiliary proteins (p12, p13, p30, and HBZ/SBZ). First, we performed multiple sequence alignment using the sequence from an HTLV-1 subtype A strain that contains ORFs for all proteins as the reference genome (GenBank accession number: AF033817). We then predicted a protein to be encoded if it has an ATG triplet corresponding to the initiation codon (ATG) in the reference genome, and we noted the location of nonsense mutations that resulted in predicted truncation of the protein. We then examined the degree to which the auxiliary and regulatory proteins are preserved in the various strains
